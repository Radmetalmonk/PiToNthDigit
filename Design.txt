Project: Pi to the Nth Digit
Author: Tim Lindsted (Radmetalmonk; TELindsted@gmail.com)
Purpose: Educational; Library

Language: C#
Interface: Console
Description: The program will calculate and display pi to the nth digit.

Inputs: 
[0] int N, integer that limits the amount of digits to display

Outputs: 
[0] double Result, Pi to the Nth digit

Warnings:
[0] Output must be limited to X characters, internalized in the program.

Methods: 
[0] Using trig functions, I found that pi can be calculated a variety of ways.  I'm going with Pi = 4.0 * arctan(1.0).  A possible holdup on this method lies within the builtin trig functions of c#.
[0.a] We are limited based on current storage capacity of computing (double long?).

[1] Calculate each digit of pi and store in an array (or list).  So caculate Pi to n digits would have a collection with n places (+1 for the 3, or +2 for the 3.) This method would be much slower than simply truncating the result of 4*Math.Atan(1) but would allow for pi to be calculated to N places legitemently.  Check out Source[1] for some hints on doing this with methods such as infinite series.

Structure:
1 Class does all the work
